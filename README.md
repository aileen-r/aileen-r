# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack web developer and I've built websites for some of the biggest media and entertainment names you can think of.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently **open to work** and looking for a full-time position. Open to remote, but Edinburgh area preferred.


## I work with...

**VueJS** is my jam, but I'm just as proficient with **React**. On the backend I work with **.NET Core**, particularly **ABP Framework**.

## I would like to start working with...

**NodeJS** seems like the most exciting backend tech to learn, and I already love working in JavaScript.
