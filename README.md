![Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aileen Rae](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cq7t2lpu3mi5ti5dawk4.png)

I'm a full stack web developer and I've built websites for some of the biggest media and entertainment names you can think of.

ðŸ’¼ I'm currently **open to work** and looking for a full-time position. Open to remote, but Edinburgh area preferred.


### I work with...

**VueJS** is my jam, but I'm just as proficient with **React**. On the backend I work with **.NET Core**, particularly **ABP Framework**.

### I would like to start working with...

**NodeJS** seems like the most exciting backend tech to learn, and I already love working in JavaScript.

### You can also find me...

I occasionally make small front end bits and bobs on [**Codepen**](https://codepen.io/aileen-r).

I also float around on [**DEV.to**](https://dev.to/aileenr), as I aspire to do some dev blogging.
