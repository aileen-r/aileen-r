![Hello World ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aileen Rae](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/cq7t2lpu3mi5ti5dawk4.png)

I'm a (mostly) frontend web developer working at [**Dayshape**](https://dayshape.com/) on the main Gantt interface in the resource management product. The bulk of my work is in data-heavy business logic, but recently I've been focussing on accessibility and our UI component library during our migration to Vue.


### I work with...

**VueJS** is my jam, but I have a handful of years of experience with **React** (and **AngularJS** but I'd rather not work with it again). On the backend I work with **.NET** professionally while tinkering with **NodeJS** in my own time (JavaScript is my happy place).

### You can also find me...

I occasionally make small front end bits and bobs on [**Codepen**](https://codepen.io/aileen-r).

I also float around on [**DEV.to**](https://dev.to/aileenr) where I blog once in a blue moon.

If you're looking to reach out the more boring and professional way, you can message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aileen-rae/).
